# NOTE: The ovs-vswitchd is in the dataplane when ovs is deploy with dpdk
# so restarting the ovs service will cause a network outage if there
# are workloads running on the host. as such we need to restart the
# ovs sparingly and only when needed. This handler is here to allow
# aggregation of restarts to minimize the number of restarts in the future
# if required. it is currently unused.
