Contributing plugins
--------------------

All plugins contributed to the edpm-ansible can be found in the
`plugins` directory, from the root of this project.
When contributing a plugin, make sure to also add documentation in the
`docs/source/plugins` folder. All documentation added to this folder will be
automatically indexed and rendered via `sphinx`.
